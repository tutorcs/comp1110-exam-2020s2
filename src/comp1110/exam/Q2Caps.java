   * Q2 Part I (2 marks)
   *
   * Open the specified input file.  If the caps boolean is false, simply
   * copy all bytes of the input file to the specified output file.  Part II
   * covers the case where the caps boolean is true.
   *
   *
   * Q2 Part II (3 marks)
   *
   * Open the specified input file.  If the caps boolean is true then copy all
   * bytes of the input file directly to the output file, except any word of
   * twenty characters or less that is immediately followed by an exclamation
   * mark ('!').  Such words should be converted to all caps before copied to
   * the output file.  Words longer than 20 characters are copied directly,
   * without capitalizing.
   *
   * A word is defined as a sequence of alphabetical characters ('a' .. 'z' and
   * 'A' .. 'Z') preceded and followed by a non-alphabetical character.
   *
   * Examples (input file contents on left, output on right):
   *  "hi" -> "hi"
   *  "hi!" -> "HI!"
   *  "hi !" -> "hi !"
   *  "Hi there!" -> "Hi THERE!"
   *  "6hi!  Foo" -> "6HI!  Foo"
   *  "6hi4!  Foo" -> "6hi4!  Foo"
   *  "super!" -> "SUPER!"
   *  "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!" -> "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!"
   *
   * @param input The name of the input file
   * @param output The name of the output file
   * @param caps if true, capitalize words 20 characters or less if they
   *             are followed by an exclamation mark.
