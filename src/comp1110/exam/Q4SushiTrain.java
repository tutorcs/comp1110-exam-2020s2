/**
 * COMP1110 Final Exam, Question 4
 *
 * 20 Marks
 *
 * This question is about a data structure that closely resembles a sushi
 * train.
 *
 * A sushi train is a continuously moving belt with a N holders, each designed
 * to hold a plate of sushi.  Sushi plates are added or removed at the kitchen
 * (position 0), and may be removed by customers at any other position
 * (1 to N - 1), as the belt passes by.
 *
 * The data structure has the concept of holders (which move on the belt), and
 * positions, which are fixed, with the holders continuously moving past.  There
 * are the same number of positions and holders.
 *
 * Each holder may be either empty or hold a single object of type T.
 *
 * Objects can only be added at position 0, and only when there is an
 * empty holder in that position.
 *
 * Objects can be removed at any position.
 *
 * The belt can advance.   Each time it advances, all holders move forward
 * one position modulus the number of positions in the train.

     * at position 1, etc.

     * Values in the train are separated by commas (without spaces).

     * If a holder is empty (null), its value is represented by the empty string,
     * still including a comma to mark its place in the train.
     * For example, a train of size five in which:
     * - the holder at position 0 contains "b"
     * - the holder at position 1 contains "c"
     * - the holder at position 2 is empty
     * - the holder at position 3 is empty
     * - the holder at position 4 is empty contains "a"
     * would be represented as "b,c,,,a".
     * A train of size three where the holder at position 0 contains "zz" and the
     * other holders are empty would be represented as "zz,,".
     * An empty train of size seven would be represented as ",,,,,,".
     *
     * @return a String representation of this sushi train
