/**
 * COMP1110 Final Exam, Question 4
 *
 * 20 Marks
 *
 * A ferris wheel has a fixed number of cars arranged in a circle.
 * Each car may either be empty, or hold a single object of type T.
 * At any time, one car is at the bottom of the wheel,
 * and all other cars are in the air.
 * Objects can be loaded or unloaded from the car at the bottom,
 * and cannot be loaded or unloaded from any other car.
 * The wheel can spin around to move a new car to the bottom.

     * so on ending with the car that is last in order to become the bottom
     * car.
     * Values in the wheel are separated by commas (without spaces).
     * Each value is converted to string as by {@link String#valueOf(Object)}.
     * If a car is empty (null), its value is represented by the empty string,
     * still including a comma to mark its place in the wheel.
     * For example, a wheel of five cars in which:
     * - the bottom car contains "b"
     * - the following car contains "c"
     * - the following car is empty
     * - the following car is empty
     * - the following car contains "a"
     * would be represented as "b,c,,,a".
     * A wheel of three cars where the bottom car contains "zz" and the other
     * cars are empty would be represented as "zz,,".
     * An empty wheel of seven cars would be represented as ",,,,,,".
     *
     * @return a String representation of this ferris wheel
