  /**
   * This question is about a number finding puzzle.
   *
   * You will be given a square grid of numbers, represented as a single
   * array of integers.   Each value in the grid is a number between 0 and 9.
   * You will also be given a target number.   Your task is to try to find
   * the target number within the grid.  If you find it, you return the
   * index of the grid element holding the first digit of the number.  If
   * you can't find it, return -1.
   *
   * Numbers can be 'hidden' in the grid by consecutive digits being in
   * horizontally or vertically adjacent elements (but not diagonally).
   * When creating numbers, digits in the grid may only be used ONCE.
   *
   * For example, given the 3 x 3 grid [2, 4, 4, 0, 5, 7, 7, 1, 4] and the
   * target 42, you would return 1.   Visualizing the grid:
   *
   *    2 4 4
   *    0 5 7
   *    7 1 4
   *
   *    2 4 _
   *    _ _ _
   *    _ _ _
   *
   * The number 42 is 'hidden' in the first two elements of the grid, starting
   * at offset 1 then going left, so the answer is 1.
   *
   * Given the 6 x 6 grid [0, 8, 0, 9, 1, 1, 6, 7, 6, 3, 2, 9, 2, 7, 7, 9, 2, 8, 4, 0, 9, 2, 9, 2, 0, 5, 1, 1, 5, 9, 8, 5, 7, 1, 1, 7],
   * and the target 91507, you would return 20.  Visualizing the grid:
   *
   *  0 8 0 9 1 1
   *  6 7 6 3 2 9
   *  2 7 7 9 2 8
   *  4 0 9 2 9 2
   *  0 5 1 1 5 9
   *  8 5 7 1 1 7
   *
   *  _ _ _ _ _ _
   *  _ _ _ _ _ _
   *  _ 7 _ _ _ _
   *  _ 0 9 _ _ _
   *  _ 5 1 _ _ _
   *  _ _ _ _ _ _
   *
   *  The number 91507 is 'hidden' in the grid starting at location 20,
   *  then going down, then left, then up twice.
   *
   * @param grid An array of integers between 0 and 9, where the size of the
   *             array is square (1, 4, 9, 16 etc).
   * @param target A target number which may be hidden in the grid.
   * @return If the target number is hidden in the grid, return the location
   * (index) within the grid of the first digit of the target number, or -1
   * if it is not in the grid.
